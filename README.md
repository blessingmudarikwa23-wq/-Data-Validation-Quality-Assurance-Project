#  Data Validation & Quality Assurance Project  
## Integrated Project: Validating and Transforming Water Access Data

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on **data validation, cleaning, and transformation** of water access datasets to ensure reliability, consistency, and analytical readiness.

The objective was to identify inconsistencies, validate records, standardize data formats, and prepare structured datasets for further analysis and reporting.

High-quality data is critical for informed decision-making. This project demonstrates practical data validation techniques using Python and analytical thinking to ensure dataset integrity.
