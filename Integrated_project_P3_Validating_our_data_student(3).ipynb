Our quest for data validation had hit a snag, but as any seasoned data scientist will tell you, every problem is a hidden opportunity waiting to be discovered.\n",

        "Here our approach needs to be a bit different. If we create a module with a bunch of functions, we are going to have a hard time moving the DataFrame around the whole time. Instead, we're going to build a Class that encapsulates the whole data processing process for the field-related data called `FieldDataProcessor`. In the class, we will create a DataFrame attribute and methods that alter that attribute. So we encapsulate all of the logic in this `FieldDataProcessor` class, we abstract all of the details and only need to call something like `FieldDataProcessor.process_data()`.\n",

        "We could even include Inheritance and Polymorphism if we create a `DataProcessor` super class and create subclasses for `FieldDataProcessor` and `WeatherDataProcessor`.  But, there is a good reason not to. The data handling of the field data is quite different from the handling of the weather data. The field data comes from an SQL database, and we transform the data in a particular way, while the weather data is sourced from a CSV, and processed differently.\n",
